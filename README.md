# Password Checker
 A neat project that can help you to check if your passwords had ever been pwned.
 
 All you have to do is start the script from the terminal and write all the passwords you want to check.
 
 Like this:
 python passwordchecker.py password123 hello123 asdasdasd
 
 Mind that you need requests package installed in order for script to work.
 
 To install it you need to type:
 pip install requests
